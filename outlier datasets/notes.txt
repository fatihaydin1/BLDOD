This synthetically generated dataset can be used to evaluate outlier detection algorithms. It has 10 attributes and 1000 observations, of which 100 are labeled as outliers. Two-dimensional combinations of attributes form differently shaped clusters.


Attribute 0 & Attribute 1: Two circular clusters
Attribute 2 & Attribute 3: Two banana shaped clusters
Attribute 4 & Attribute 5: Three point clouds
Attribute 6 & Attribute 7: Two point clouds with variances
Attribute 8 & Attribute 9: Three anisotropic shaped clusters.
